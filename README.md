1. Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true 
---------------------------------------------------------------

2. Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string array as queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.

Example 1:

Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").

Example 2:

Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
-----------------------------------------------------------------

3. For strings S and T, we say "T divides S" if and only if S = T + ... + T  (T concatenated with itself 1 or more times)

Return the largest string X such that X divides str1 and X divides str2.

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"

Example 2:

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"

Example 3:

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
-----------------------------------------------------------------

4. We are given a matrix with R rows and C columns has cells with integer coordinates (r, c), where 0 <= r < R and 0 <= c < C.

Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates (r0, c0).

Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from (r0, c0) from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is the Manhattan distance, |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.  (You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.)

Example 1:

Input: R = 1, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1]

Example 2:

Input: R = 2, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 1
Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.

Example 3:

Input: R = 2, C = 3, r0 = 1, c0 = 2
Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].
-----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
